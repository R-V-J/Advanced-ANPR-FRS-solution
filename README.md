# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Facial Recognition
#### Design and develop a technological solution that can accurately perform the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) along with Facial Recognition from the available CCTV feeds. The solution should be able to recognize number plates that are written in typical non-standard ways using varying font styles, sizes, designs, symbols, languages etc., i.e. difficult to recognize by existing ANPR Systems.

## üìùDescription
This is one of the unique projects done by a team of six members which inludes the domain of **video analytics and CCTV**. In this prroject, we extensively used the **computer vision and the image processing** technologies using various in-built modules and libraries of **Python** programming language. As a part of our attempt to the **KAVACH 2023 - The Cybersecurity Hackathon**, we tried to advance the existing technologies by adding few valuable edits.
